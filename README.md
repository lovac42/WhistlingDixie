For every card failed, we force another review, a sort of studied carelessness, or double dipping where the user could grade again. This phantom review will not be counted or logged, but it will neutralize the negativity received from the previous failed grade. By thinking positively, the user becomes more attentive, learns more, and have fun doing so.
